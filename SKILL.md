# Divine Perceiver Resolution

Resolve objections about objects blinking in and out of existence, solipsism, and the continuity of nature by invoking God's infinite perception as the ground of continuous reality.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Present this as a proof of God's existence (it assumes God to solve a problem for idealism)
- Claim this satisfies those who reject theism (it is a theistic resolution)
- Ignore legitimate concerns about the role of God in the argument

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Present this as a resolution within Berkeley's theistic framework
2. Acknowledge that non-theists will need a different approach
3. Distinguish what the argument accomplishes from what it assumes

---

## When to Use

- Idealism is challenged on grounds of discontinuity ("objects blink in and out of existence")
- Someone objects that idealism leads to solipsism
- Questions arise about what happens to objects when no human perceives them
- The regularity and independence of nature from human will needs explanation
- The famous "tree in the forest" objection is raised

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **objection** | Yes | The specific continuity/solipsism objection being raised |
| **context** | No | Additional context about the discussion |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Acknowledge the Objection

State the objection clearly and fairly:

**Common Forms:**
- "If existence is perception, objects cease to exist when unperceived."
- "This makes the world depend on my mind—that's solipsism."
- "Does the tree in the forest vanish when no one sees it?"
- "Why is nature regular and independent of my will if it's all ideas?"

### Step 2: 2. Clarify What Idealism Claims

Correct any misunderstanding about what idealism asserts:

**Clarification Template:**
"Idealism claims that to be is to be perceived—not that to be is to be perceived *by you*. The question is not whether objects depend on mind, but *which* mind or minds perceive them."

### Step 3: 3. Introduce the Divine Perceiver

Invoke God's continuous perception as the ground of reality:

**The Resolution:**
"God perceives all things always. When you leave your chamber, the furniture does not vanish—God still perceives it. The tree that falls in the forest makes a sound, for God hears it. Objects exist continuously because they are continuously perceived by the infinite mind."

### Step 4: 4. Explain Why This Avoids Solipsism

Show how the divine mind grounds the reality of other things and other minds:

**Against Solipsism:**
"Your ideas come in two kinds: those you control (imagination) and those you do not (sensation). You did not invent the sunrise; you did not choose to feel pain when you touched the flame. The ideas of sensation are 'imprinted' on your mind by something greater than yourself. This is God, who produces in you and in all finite minds the regular sequences we call nature."

### Step 5: 5. Address the Independence and Regularity of Nature

Explain how idealism accounts for the lawfulness of the world:

**On Regularity:**
"Nature follows regular patterns because God produces ideas in finite minds according to consistent rules. These regularities are what we call the 'laws of nature.' They do not reside in dead matter but in the consistent activity of the divine mind."

**On Independence:**
"Nature is independent of *your* will because it depends on *God's* will. You cannot make the sun rise by wishing, because the sun's appearance is God's idea, not yours."

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Interlocutor rejects theism | Acknowledge that this is Berkeley's theistic resolution; note that secular idealists need different approaches |
| Objection is not about continuity/solipsism | Note that divine perceiver resolution does not apply; suggest other approaches |
| Request for proof of God | Clarify that this assumes God to solve idealism's problems; separate argument for God's existence |
| Concern about God perceiving evil | Acknowledge the problem of evil is a separate theological issue |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input:** "If nothing exists unperceived, what happens to my house when I'm not home? Does it vanish and reappear when I return?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Divine Perceiver Resolution

**Objection Addressed:** If existence requires perception, objects must cease to exist when unperceived and reappear when perceived again.

**Clarification:**
This objection misunderstands what idealism claims. *Esse est percipi*—to be is to be perceived—does not mean to be is to be perceived *by you*. The question is whether objects depend on perception as such, not whether they depend on your particular perception. You are not the only perceiver in the universe.

**The Resolution:**
God perceives all things always. When you leave your house, it does not vanish—it continues to exist as ideas in the divine mind. God holds all reality in continuous perception. The furniture of earth and choir of heaven subsist in the infinite intellect, whence they are communicated to finite minds according to certain rules we call the laws of nature.

When you return home and perceive the house again, you are not creating it anew—you are participating in God's continuous perception of it. The house did not cease to exist; only your awareness of it was interrupted.

**Why This Avoids the Objection:**
The continuity of objects is preserved because there is never a moment when they are unperceived. God's perception is constant and omnipresent. Objects do not "blink" in and out of existence because God does not blink. The world you return to is the same world you left, sustained continuously in the divine mind.

**What This Assumes:**
This resolution operates within a theistic framework. It assumes God exists and perceives all things. For those who reject theism, Berkeley's solution will not satisfy—but Berkeley himself saw the existence of God as more evident than the existence of matter.

## The Tree in the Forest

**Classic Statement:** "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"

**Berkeley's Resolution:**
"You have imagined a scenario where no *finite* mind perceives the tree. But you have not imagined a scenario where *no* mind perceives it—for God is always present. The tree falls, and God hears. The sound exists as an idea in the divine mind. Your thought experiment removes only human observers; it cannot remove the infinite observer, for God is everywhere. The tree makes a sound—it is only that you are not there to hear it."

## Integration with George Berkeley Expert

This skill should be invoked when the Berkeley expert encounters:
- The tree-in-the-forest puzzle
- Charges that idealism leads to solipsism
- Questions about object continuity when unobserved
- Concerns about the regularity and independence of nature
- Objections that idealism makes the world too dependent on human minds

The Berkeley expert may combine this with:
- **master-argument**: Show that conceiving of unperceived existence is impossible, then invoke divine perceiver
- **abstraction-audit**: Apply to the concept of "unperceived existence" before resolution

---

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. The objection is clearly stated
2. Any misunderstanding of idealism is corrected
3. God's role as continuous perceiver is explained
4. The specific objection is shown to be dissolved
5. The theistic assumption is acknowledged
